# 🚨 Deployment Failure Diagnosis

## **CURRENT SITUATION ANALYSIS:**

### **❌ What's Happening:**
- GitHub Actions: `deployment failed: tasks failed to start`
- AWS Console: `3 Failed tasks` visible
- Deployment Status: `In progress` (but stuck in retry loop)
- Tasks: `0 pending | 0 running` (tasks can't start)
- Duration: 9+ minutes (abnormally long)

### **🔍 ROOT CAUSE:**
**IAM Role Trust Policies are NOT fixed yet!**

The deployment is stuck because:
1. ECS tries to start a task
2. ECS can't assume the IAM roles (trust policy issue)
3. Task fails to start
4. ECS retries (causing the long delay)
5. Process repeats indefinitely

## **🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

### **PRIORITY 1: Fix IAM Roles (CRITICAL)**
```
AWS Console → IAM → Roles → ecsTaskExecutionRole
→ Trust relationships → Edit trust policy
→ Replace with exact policy from fix-iam-roles-trust-policy.md
→ Repeat for ecsTaskRole
```

### **PRIORITY 2: Create Secrets**
```
AWS Console → Secrets Manager → Store new secret
→ Create: movie-management/mongodb-uri
→ Create: movie-management/jwt-secret
→ Use values from secrets-manager-values.md
```

### **PRIORITY 3: Cancel & Restart**
```
Cancel current GitHub Actions deployment
→ Fix IAM roles and create secrets
→ Re-run GitHub Actions deployment
→ Should succeed in ~3-5 minutes
```

## **🎯 WHY THIS ORDER MATTERS:**
- **IAM roles** are the fundamental blocker
- **Secrets** are needed for the application to run
- **Current deployment** will never succeed without these fixes

**Fix IAM roles FIRST - everything else depends on this!** 🚨
