# Create ECS Services for Movie Management App

## 🎯 **CRITICAL STEP: Create ECS Services**

The GitHub Actions deployment expects these services to exist. Create them manually:

### **📋 Service 1: Backend Service**

1. **AWS Console** → **ECS** → **Clusters** → **movie-management-cluster**
2. **Services** tab → **Create** button
3. **Configuration:**
   ```
   Launch type: Fargate
   Task Definition: movie-backend-task (select latest revision)
   Service name: movie-backend-service
   Number of tasks: 1
   
   VPC: Default VPC
   Subnets: Select all available subnets
   Security groups: Default security group
   Auto-assign public IP: ENABLED
   
   Load balancer: None (for now)
   ```
4. **Create Service**

### **📋 Service 2: Frontend Service**

1. **Services** tab → **Create** button  
2. **Configuration:**
   ```
   Launch type: Fargate
   Task Definition: movie-frontend-task (select latest revision)
   Service name: movie-frontend-service
   Number of tasks: 1
   
   VPC: Default VPC
   Subnets: Select all available subnets
   Security groups: Default security group
   Auto-assign public IP: ENABLED
   
   Load balancer: None (for now)
   ```
3. **Create Service**

### **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- **Task Definitions**: If you don't see the task definitions, that's OK - the GitHub Actions will create them
- **Initial State**: Services might show as "PENDING" initially - this is normal
- **After Creation**: Re-run the GitHub Actions deployment

### **🚀 NEXT STEPS:**

1. Create both services above
2. Go to **GitHub** → **Actions**
3. **Re-run** the failed deployment
4. **Watch your app go live!** 🎬

---

**Status**: Services created → GitHub Actions deployment → Live app! 🚀
